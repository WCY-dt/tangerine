If you want to add a picture stored locally, you need to move the picture to the `assets/post/images` folder in the root directory of your Jekyll project. Then you can use the following Markdown syntax to add the picture:

```markdown
![Alt text](/assets/post/images/pic.webp)
```

![Alt text](/assets/post/images/pic.webp)
